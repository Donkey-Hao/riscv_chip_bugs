# RISC-V Chip Bugs

This repository collects historical bug-triggering instructions for open-source RISC-V chip designs, such as BOOM and Rocket. The instructions included may no longer trigger bugs due to fixes in the underlying implementations. This project aims to serve as a reference for developers and researchers interested in the evolution of RISC-V designs and the resolution of previous vulnerabilities.
